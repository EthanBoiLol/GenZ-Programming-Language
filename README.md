# Gen Z Programming language

## inspired by (insert link here)

### in modern age, many top jobs are at threat, including programming, with layoffs and job displacement. We need more young folks to get into programming; of course, many attempts has been made, such as block code, but it proves unsuccessful...

### We realized that the best way to promote programming is to """localize""" the syntax for the newest generation. Welcome to the GenZ Programming Language

I need mental help....


## installation

### W Software that is required
1. Python 3
2. OS python module
3. time python module
4. g++

### Getting Started

1. Write your .GenZ file
2. run GenZ_Compiler.py
3. Enter the filename of the GenZ code
4. enter name for output
5. locate your compiled code in `build/` and run it
6. enjoy


# Documentation
## Syntax

The syntax is very similar to that of C++. The main difference being the re-wording of several syntax names

### variables

#### data types:

`fax` - A true/false value

`basic` - A whole number value

`period` - a number with decimal support that contains 4 bytes

`body_count` - a number with decimal support that contains 8 bytes

`jit` - a value that can hold a character

`yap` - a value that can hold a series of characters

`gagged` - when a function doesn't return anything

#### values:

`cap` - a value that is false

`noCap` - a value that is true

#### change values:

`extra` - adds 1 to value

`ded` - subs 1 to value

### Keywords
#### declaring Values and/or functions:

`highkey` - when the item is public

`lowkey` - when the item is private

`gatekeep` - when the item is protected

`bussy` - declaring a structure

`glaze` - declaring a constant

`bussin` - declaring a reference

`flex` - declaring a pointer


#### equivalents for C++:

`vibe_check` - equivalent to an "if" statement

`big_yikes` - equivalent to an "else" statement

`fuck_around` - equivalent to "try"

`find_out` - equivalent to "catch"

`yeet` - equivalent to "throw"

`its_giving` - equivalent to "return"

`main_character` - equivalent to "main"

`moots` - equivalent to "while"

`fanum_tax` - equivalent to "for"

`mew` - equivalent to "do"

`beta` - equivalent of "min"

`alpha` - equivalent of "max"

`ick` - equivalent to "break"

`ghost` - equivalent to "continue"

`skibidi` - equivalent to "class"


### Header

`#fit` - includes functions and classes of 3rd party libraries

`cook` - does the "using namespace"

#### Custom library names:

`<sigma>` - imports iostream

`<ohio>` - imports ofstream

`<florida>` - imports ifstream

`<sus>` - imports fstream

### Operators

`ratios` - greater than

`ratios_+_L` - Greater than or equal to

`unratios` - less than

`unratios_+_L` - less than or equal to


`mid` - if values equal each other

`cooked` - if values do not equal each other

### Other functions

`Shoutout` - equivalent to "std"

`slay` - equivalent to "endl"

`SpillTea` - equivalent to "cout"

`rent-free` - equivalent to "cin"

`bde(x)` - get's the size of yap

## Examples

"Hello Sigmas!" program:

```
#fit <sigma>

cook Shoutout;


basic main_character()
{
  SpillTea << "Hello Sigmas!" << slay;
